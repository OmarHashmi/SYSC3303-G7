Tom Pieroni:
Elevator Subsystem
Motor Class
ArrivalSensor Class
ElevatorDoor Class
ElevatorButton Class
ElevatorLamp Class
Made the elevator instruct appropriate types to perform action dependent on messages from the scheduler. E.g. move the motor down, open the doors
Message Class
Created framework for Elevator to communicate with scheduler and vice versa
Elevator State machine
Methods that respond to scheduler messages and update the elevator state accordingly
Added States (UP, DOWN, IDLE, DOORSOPENING, DOORSCLOSING)

Thomas Poetting:
Added more events to the elevator_events.txt to cover more kinds of events
Changed scheduler to now take in the same messenger instance as Elevator.java
Added to Box.java
add(ArrayList<ElevatorEvent> events) - to be able to add a list of elevatorEvents
Added to Message.java
setFloor() -  takes the floor as a string from Elevator.java arrivalSensor 
getFloor() - gets the set floor to be used by Scheduler.java
Added to Scheduler.java;
organizeEvents() - takes an array list of events from Floor.java and organizes them into sequences to be used by the scheduler later
sendInstruction()  - takes in a string from the predeclared set of instructions and sends it to Elevator.java using Message.java
communicateWithElevator() - is called after the sequences are organized and then uses that list of sequences to determine what instructions to send to sendInstructions() and communicate with the Elevator.java

Omar Hashmi:
Created test cases for subsystems
Updated BoxTest
Updated FloorTest
Added SchedulerTest
Added ElevatorTest
Refactored box to clean code
Separated data structures to new package

Sam Zoubi:
Move() method in elevator to move the elevator 
 callForElevator() - communication between Floor and Scheduler. Sending elevator events to be scheduled by the Scheduler
processUserCall() - communication between Elevator and Scheduler. To send elevator events from scheduler to elevator to execute.
completeCall()- communication between Elevator and Scheduler. A method called by the Elevator class to the Scheduler class to inform the Scheduler it has completed its elevator event and arrived on the destination floor.
